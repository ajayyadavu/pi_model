I a steady and productive climb into equipment engineering developing many software systems and applications along the way. From 87C52 device microcode for high speed servo applications to multi-process multi-threaded desktop graphical applications I have to hone my skills building industrial strength software for the global market. My most recent project involved developing blob analysis applications for wafer map processes using MS Visual C#. I continue to development my own products maintaining my software skills using the latest leading edge technology. WORK EXPERIENCE LTS Software Engineer Computational Lithography IBM Corporation - September 2011 to Present Re-engineering of unit test processes that guarentee functionality of all Perl based applications used for IBM's Computational Lithography Processes.

These applications incorporate the use of Mentor Graphics - Calibre - products to provide Optical Proximity Correction for IBM's 200 - 300mm wafer fab mask operations. Customer Engineer APPLIED MATERIALS INC - February 2007 to March 2010 Developed C# based application to graphically analyze wafer maps in an attempt to isolate hotspots on 300 mm wafers which would allow repositioning for optimum process operation. These programs used blob analysis to identify key areas of the wafer that indicated xy corrections direction and theta rotation. Materials Coordinator NSTAR GLOBAL SERVICES - April 2004 to February 2007 Materials coordinator. Handled spare parts for Applied Materials operations in Fishkill NY Software Engineer IBM Corporation - Burlington VT - May 1997 to September 2003 Developed a real time multithreaded Java based SAS command processor for wafer final test use.

This was a 20000 line program written in C using OS2's presentation engine which allowed the user to graphically display the part under test and manipulate it to produce alignment and height mapping points. It also allowed an off-line method of optimizing a test sequence. Visual Test Generator. I invented an offline OS/2 graphical application to generate a test file from the device's net list called the Visual Test Generator. This required many optimization algorithms and enabled the test engineer to graphically refine a test program for maximum optimization. Programming Technician IBM Corporation - July 1983 to June 1986 PC Chip In Place Test Automation. Our team transformed an existing tester into a fully automatic functional chip tester. Utilizing ARTIC technology and Intel 87C51 embedded microcontrollers we developed multitasking real time software to control various pieces of the tester using C and PLM. CIPT Automatic Alignment. Automatic alignment of test probe to pads was accomplished using Cognex machine vision and custom application code that we developed using C. This project also required us to develop a pre Windows GUI screen management system. Module Assembly Tool Diagnostics.

I am currently preparing for the exam with practice books and through continuing education on Open Course Ware at MIT. I am taking calculus courses to strengthen my basis for high-level algebra and statistics courses. This course load aids me in preparing for the exam and will introduce me to data science technologies like the R and Python languages. My current goal is to become well-practiced for the exam so that I can handle practice exams in a time-efficient manner (and score in the 90th percentile) and to become familiar enough with data science to know what areas of the exam are most relevant to the field so as to determine what areas should be emphasized in my studies. While pursuing these educational goals I hope to learn more about the data science field professionally through my career. My full- stack development experience assists me towards this end but my drive to learn will lead me to become a data scientist professional in the future.

American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene http://www.ajtmh.org/content/88/4/630.short February 4 2013 Published Abstract In this study we evaluate the effect of participatory Ecohealth interventions on domestic reinfestation of the Chagas disease vector Triatoma dimidiata after village-wide suppression of the vector population using a residual insecticide. The study was conducted in the rural community of La Brea Guatemala between 2002 and 2009 where vector infestation was analyzed within a spatial data framework based on entomological and socio-economic surveys of homesteads within the village. Participatory interventions focused on community awareness and low-cost home improvements using local materials to limit areas of refuge and alternative blood meals for the vector within the home and potential shelter for the vector outside the home. As a result domestic infestation was maintained at �__ 3% and peridomestic infestation at �__ 2% for 5 years beyond the last insecticide spraying in sharp contrast to the rapid reinfestation experienced in earlier insecticide only interventions. Household model of Chagas disease vectors (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) considering domestic peridomestic and sylvatic vector populations. Journal of Medical Entomology http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1603/ME12096 May 7 2013 Published Abstract Disease transmission is difficult to model because most vectors and hosts have different generation times. Chagas disease is such a situation where insect vectors have 1���2 generations annually and mammalian hosts including humans can live for decades. The hemataphagous triatominae vectors (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) of the causative parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) usually feed on sleeping hosts making vector infestation of houses peridomestic areas and wild animal burrows a central factor in transmission. Because of difficulties with different generation times we developed a model considering the dwelling as the unit of infection changing the dynamics from an indirect to a direct transmission model. In some regions vectors only infest houses; in others they infest corrals; and in some regions they also infest wild animal burrows. We examined the effect of sylvatic and peridomestic vector populations on household infestation rates. Both sylvatic and peridomestic vectors increase house infestation rates sylvatic much more than peridomestic as measured by the reproductive number R0. The efficacy of manipulating parameters in the model to control vector populations was examined. When R0 > 1 the number of infested houses increases. The presence of sylvatic vectors increases R0 by at least an order of magnitude. When there are no sylvatic vectors spraying rate is the most influential parameter. Spraying rate is relatively unimportant when there are sylvatic vectors; in this case community size especially the ratio of houses to sylvatic burrows is most important. The application of this modeling approach to other parasites and enhancements of the model are discussed. Vector blood meals and Chagas disease transmission potential United States. Emerging Infectious Diseases http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/4/11-1396_article.htm April 2012 Published Abstract A high proportion of triatomine insects vectors for Trypanosoma cruzi trypanosomes collected in Arizona and California and examined using a novel assay had fed on humans. Other triatomine insects were positive for T. cruzi parasite infection which indicates that the potential exists for vector transmission of Chagas disease in the United States. Chagas Disease: Trypanosoma cruzi the first hundred years Triatomine Biology Chapter 8 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/0065308X/75 2011 Published Abstract A complete picture of Chagas disease requires an appreciation of the many species of kissing bugs and their role in transmitting this disease to humans and other mammals. This chapter provides an overview of the taxonomy of the major species of kissing bugs and their evolution. Knowledge of systematics and biological kinship of these insects may contribute to novel and useful measures to control the bugs. The biology of kissing bugs their life cycle method of feeding and other behaviours contributing to the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi are explained. We close with a discussion of vector control measures and the allergic complications of kissing bug bites a feature of particular importance in the United States. A method for the identification of guinea pig blood meal in the Chagas disease vector Triatoma infestans http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/6/1/1 Published Abstract Background In a SINE-based PCR assay a primer set specific for guinea pig genome short interspersed elements DNA was used to test the utility of genomic markers for identifying the source of vertebrate blood meals of Triatoma infestans. Methods The investigation consisted of two assays. In Assay 1 thirty-six insects collected from the Province of ZudaՁn��ez in Chuquisaca Bolivia were frozen 1���40 hours after feeding under controlled conditions on guinea pigs. The species of the vertebrate host was confirmed from dissection of the posterior part of the abdomen of each insect followed by DNA extraction and PCR amplification. Assay 2 investigated whether the technique worked under field conditions. We analyzed the bloodmeal of 34 insects collected from households and peri- domestic structures from communities where wild and captive guinea pigs occur. After collection the insects were maintained at room temperature for 2 months without feeding and then analyzed. Results In Assay 1 each of the 36 insects allowed to feed on guinea pig blood tested positive for guinea pig DNA. The guinea pig DNA was reliably identified in as little as 1 hour and up to 40 hours after feeding. For Assay 2 8 out of the 34 samples (23%) showed positive results with guinea pig specific primers. Conclusion The results in assay 1 demonstrated that DNA from the vertebrate host can be amplified 1���40 hours post feeding from the abdomen of the blood-feeding Chagas disease vector Triatoma infestans. The results in assay 2 confirmed that the procedure works on insects collected from households and peri-domestic structures and that the source of a blood meal can be determined at least 2 months post feeding. PCR reveals significantly higher rates of Trypanosoma cruzi infection than microscopy in the Chagas vector Triatoma infestans: High rates found in Chuquisaca Bolivia http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/7/66 June 27 2007 Published Abstract Background The Andean valleys of Bolivia are the only reported location of sylvatic Triatoma infestans the main vector of Chagas disease in this country and the high human prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in this region is hypothesized to result from the ability of vectors to persist in domestic peri-domestic and sylvatic environments. Determination of the rate of Trypanosoma infection in its triatomine vectors is an important element in programs directed at reducing human infections. Traditionally T. cruzi has been detected in insect vectors by direct microscopic examination of extruded feces or dissection and analysis of the entire bug. Although this technique has proven to be useful several drawbacks related to its sensitivity especially in the case of small instars and applicability to large numbers of insects and dead specimens have motivated researchers to look for a molecular assay based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as an alternative for parasitic detection of T. cruzi infection in vectors. In the work presented here we have compared a PCR assay and direct microscopic observation for diagnosis of T. cruzi infection in T. infestans collected in the field from five localities and four habitats in Chuquisaca Bolivia. The efficacy of the methods was compared across nymphal stages localities and habitats. Methods We examined 152 nymph and adult T. infestans collected from rural areas in the department of Chuquisaca Bolivia. For microscopic observation a few drops of rectal content obtained by abdominal extrusion were diluted with saline solution and compressed between a slide and a cover slip. The presence of motile parasites in 50 microscopic fields was registered using 400�� magnification. For the molecular analysis dissection of the posterior part of the abdomen of each insect followed by DNA extraction and PCR amplification was performed using the TCZ1 (5' ��� CGA GCT CTT GCC CAC ACG GGT GCT ��� 3') and TCZ2 (5' ��� CCT CCA AGC AGC GGA TAG TTC AGG ��� 3') primers. Amplicons were chromatographed on a 2% agarose gel with a 100 bp size standard stained with ethidium bromide and viewed with UV fluorescence. For both the microscopy and PCR assays we calculated sensitivity (number of positives by a method divided by the number of positives by either method) and discrepancy (one method was negative and the other was positive) at the locality life stage and habitat level. The degree of agreement between PCR and microscopy was determined by calculating Kappa (k) values with 95% confidence intervals. Results We observed a high prevalence of T. cruzi infection in T. infestans (81.16% by PCR and 56.52% by microscopy) and discovered that PCR is significantly more sensitive than microscopic observation. The overall degree of agreement between the two methods was moderate (Kappa = 0.43 α 0.07). The level of infection is significantly different among communities; however prevalence was similar among habitats and life stages. Conclusion PCR was significantly more sensitive than microscopy in all habitats developmental stages and localities in Chuquisaca Bolivia. Overall we observed a high prevalence of T. cruzi infection in T. infestans in this area of Bolivia; however microscopy underestimated infection at all levels examined.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Study and research interests MASTERS PROJECT [...] ���RUNNING SIMULATOR��� This report presented a detailed design of a ���Running Simulator��� that aimed to precisely mimic forces and motions of the foot and ankle collected over the running cycle and critically analyzed. A dynamic model has been designed to track the desired torque about the ankle and regulate the force-pressure behavior inside a pair of pneumatic muscle-tendon type actuators enabling the mean pressure (stiffness) of the pneumatic actuators to be inflated slowly but deflated quickly mimicking the energy return of biological muscles and tendons. A robot module and linearly actuated knee pivot have been designed to ensure the cyclic mass (energy) transfer from heel strike to toe off. Applications of the Running Simulator: Will increase the realism of footwear tests at an economic cost while maintaining a high repeatability. It will enable manufacturers to design shoes or prosthetic feet to reduce stresses inflicted on the runner by simulating the performance of the shoe or foot over its life cycle in a factory environment. Future work: The next step is to build a working model to validate the entire system design. Once validated the presented Computer Aided Design can be manipulated in a simulation package and controlled by the dynamic model in a pure computational simulation. This reduces the time and costs of making speculative shoe or prosthetic foot prototypes and testing them on several ���Running Simulators���.

My idea was to promote the Trail locally through work on the trail with kids from my school. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I want to start finding more jobs that will give me experience out in the field of science. More jobs that are in the field of science will boost my credentials as a scientist. This in the long run will help me grow to be respected in the scientific community. My long term goals is to eventually gain enough influence in the scientific community which will eventually gain my name respect so that my opinions are valued. Once my name is respected and my opinions valued I can start influencing regulation and policy with what the world needs it to be so the world can achieve environmental sustainable. I want our generation to be rembered as the green generation not just the technological generation.

Jake Kittell 802-888-1679 * 6/04 - Present Happiness Tech LLC Morrisville VT: Contract Machine Design and Custom Software. Principal. Happiness Tech LLC was founded to provide solutions for customers based on my principals of direct communication honesty and hard work. My experience at larger companies convinced me that I could best serve my customers from a small client oriented company. Over the first several years in business Happiness Tech LLC has produced several complete and functional machines a few complete software/database applications and a wide array of design and SolidWorks consulting and contract services for happy customers. Customers include Pratt & Whitney Suss Micro-Tec SB Electronics Northern Power Systems and iRobot Corp.

President Anderson Leveille. 802-253-2036 x 108 * 4/03-6/04 Moscow Mills Manufacturing Service. Moscow VT: Contract Engineering and Machine Shop Services. Principal Engineer. While at this small company I was involved in several projects from concept through happy customers. These included a new enclosure design for a flat panel computer to be used as an operator interface. The new design reduced weight by a factor of three while also reducing manufacturing cost and addressing major cooling issues for the LCD and computer. As well I designed and built an X-Ray enclosure to house an in-process Electron Beam system. This enclosure was a complex labyrinth path for a printing web to pass through while keeping X- Rays in. Construction was formed and welded sheet metal to form a mold that then had lead cast in place. Lead R&D Staff iRobot Corp - Jaffrey NH - April 1997 to April 2003 Member (E5) Design of mobile robots. Engineering oversight of manufacturing and quality. Operations Manager Jim Lenahan. (now at R&G Bank Note) 603-654-6185 * 4/97-4/03 iRobot Corp. (formerly Real World Interface Inc). Milford NH: Manufacturer of intelligent mobile robots. Lead R&D Staff Member. Real World Interface was a young company of fifteen people hoping to move from a start up business to a profitable manufacturing company when I started. My first mission was to establish engineering controls on the manufacturing process. This included establishing a part numbering and naming system with revision control for everything from software to resistors and gears. Many assemblies were only sketched on scraps of paper without dates or titles. From this we grew to a state where it was clearly known what we were building and what we needed to do it. Lead time for robot orders went from 1 year to just a few weeks. Cost of Goods sold on these products went from 85% to less than 45%. Jake Kittell 722 Darling Rd. 802-888-1679 Jake@HappinessTech.biz Morrisville VT 05661 Having achieved this I moved on to design work for the next generation of robots. I had primary design responsibility for our line of three All Terrain Robotic Vehicles. These are rugged outdoor vehicles that can navigate serious terrain while carrying up to two powerful PCs. There are now several hundred of them serving the needs of robotic researchers from universities to national laboratories and US military defense programs. iRobot Corp - 1999 to 1999 merged with I.S. Robotics to become iRobot Corp. The company is now 200 people strong. Work at iRobot included implementation of Oracle ERP system companywide importing half a million records from many assorted information systems. Mechanical leadership for iRobot's Packbot EOD robot. Design work included prototype design of iRobot's 7 Ft. long 6 axis robotic arm for the robot. EOD Robot This arm was designed to full military specifications able to resist all weather hi pressure wash down hi voltage electric shocks rigorous vibration and the sand of the Iraqi desert. It could lift 5 pounds at 7 feet horizontally yet weighed only 19 lbs. Design Engineer REHAU Inc - Springfield VT - October 1996 to April 1997 Until recently REHAU designed and built all fabrication machinery and tooling for its North American operations in Germany. The fairly new group that I joined has the mission to take over this machinery production. I participated in the development of new gauging concepts to better measure what was produced. I gained hands on experience with machine wiring and pneumatics. Design Engineer REHAU Inc - Springfield NH - September 1996 to April 1997 Design of fabrication machinery for PVC extrusions.

An apprentice in the most traditional sense of the word participating in engineering projects on a regular basis. My father a Principal Scientist (engineering) at Hughes/ Perkin Elmer Corporation worked mostly from our home. He is among the world's experts on micro positioning having done such things as achieve positional stability of good sized mirrors to the angstrom level for 12 hour periods. Together we made assemblies that traveled in the space shuttle and designed the machine that has polished many of the world's largest telescope mirrors (including the Hubble's). Facilities included a precision machine shop as well as thorough electronics and metrology capabilities. During this period I invented a machine to distribute mercury in arc lamps in a few seconds' time for Perkin-Elmer's lamp factory. This process was previously done by hand requiring skilled workers ten minutes per lamp. Opportunity was not spared to educate me in the ways of a craftsman. Craftsmanship is a never-ceasing desire to improve the product process and methods of what we do. I learned that attention to detail is the path to a quality finished product. Craftsmen look to the next level of performance even as the present one is being developed. I learned the skills to take a problem and develop solutions using sketches and analytical techniques to build precision parts and produce finished machinery and to make detailed drawings from the point of view of a shop person. This has been a great aid in winning the respect of shop personnel in my professional work. My Grandfather on my mother's side invented the first process to separate color images into dots for printing by Time magazine that is the foundation of modern color printing. He was an early pioneer in television and made the first non-military radar installation aboard a sea vessel while at GE. From him I gained the courage to invent whatever needs to be invented. This three generation long tradition of breaking new ground continues through my work. Related Skills People who work with me believe in my abilities to solve tough problems and to deal with them in a fair and honest way. Patience allows me to be methodical and thorough in my work and is the basis for a strong knack for having inventions work well on the first attempt. I enjoy working in group settings and utilize creative vision and listening skills to be a leader.

The sequences produced were analyzed using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology v.1.8.0 (QIIME). The goal was to determine if the disease was caused by a possible microbial causative agent. This research was also part of the Earth Microbiome Project. Other research positions involved participating on the Porifera Tree of Life Project which focused on defining the phylogenetic relationships within Porifera that still remain unsolved. In particular the monophyly of the Porifera phylum and its largest class; Demospongiae has been questioned and the relationships among its major lineages. The lack of a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for this phylum hampers progress in basic studies of sponge biology biodiversity comparative evolutionary studies and efforts to conserve sponges. The goal was to provide a phylogenetic context that would improve the understanding of all aspects of sponge biology (https://www.portol.org/). I was specifically working on identifying the genetic differences between sponge species using 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA analysis. The analyses included using software such as Geneious to evaluate sequences. I also assisted on both sub-projects of the BP oil and dispersant exposure experiment. The first looked at the effect of BP oil and dispersant on the microbial communities of sponge Cinachyrella australiensis. I evaluated a region of the 28S gene to determine is the sponge samples themselves all belonged to the sample species or if some represent a unknown subspecies. I also completed the RNA extraction for samples which looked at the Cinachyrella australiensis gene expression change to the BP oil and dispersant Skills Used While I was employed I demonstrate the ability to work independently and within a team. I took leadership roles within different research projects and general laboratory maintenance.

not_flagged,listening to girlfriend's problems
flagged,"Friend was thinking about suicide, after a few days I managed to talk her down."
flagged,"Having gone through depression and anxiety myself, I understand the struggles and have a few personal methods to cope when stuff hits. Having this knowledge has allowed me to help several people on the internet as well as my other friends when they have faced similar issues and talk to me about them. I understand how important listening is and offer my experiences to help them get through what they face."
not_flagged,"Sometimes my friends bring up issues they are having with themselves, and I feel that I give them good advice and make them feel adequate and normal. I just try to be kind and helpful and honest."

not_flagged,I am a high school teacher so almost everyday.
not_flagged,Friends often come to me to talk about the issues that they're facing in life.
not_flagged,"Summer camp, countless kids have the same issue. I tell them i how it is when you cant listen or are restless."
not_flagged,"Haha. In eight grade, kid got rejected twice. Wanted her to sign his yearbook but he was too nervous. I told him she doesn't really care about rejecting him and she thinks no less of him. He did it. Probably more, but that's what comes up off the top of my head."
not_flagged,Don't have a specific example but just letting people know you're there if they want to talk.
not_flagged,Some of my friends have gone through the same type of struggle I have been through. I let them know that they could talk to me about anything and that being honest with yourself even if the truth hurts is the best way to start to get back up.
flagged,"Friend who had big addiction issues, ended up being completely isolated, skipped school, and had a very low self esteem. I convinced him to go see a doc together, and promised him that i would go through everything with him. He went to rehab for a few months and now he's clean. But the complete lack of support from his family, from school, changed him. I think it was too late when I helped him (he was like that for 5 months) and he'll never be the same as before."
not_flagged,I've always been a good listener for people and I think a lot of people just want to be heard and not necessarily fixed. They just need to express themselves to relief their thoughts to others so they're not trapped so much within the confines of their own head. I've always lent an ear for someone to speak to.
flagged,One of my best friends was diagnosed with cancer and I did as much as I could for him during that time. I visited him almost every day when he was in treatment just so he didn't have to be alone or anything. When he came back to school I helped him get caught up with school work too.

not_flagged,Friend got dumped by girl he had been in a relationship in for 2 years. I stayed by his side until he stopped feeling bad about it. I was there for him.
not_flagged,I open myself to any friend in need of emotional support.
not_flagged,GF and I help her through a lot of shit because I myself have been through a lot of shit.
flagged,"I had a friend that would go off about girls and get super depressed. He told me he was going to kill himself one night and I drove 1n hour and a half to go look for him. By then the cops had already taken him to the hospital but me and a friend went and hung out with him. Also been there to help try and talk him down. Another person I hadnt been friends with for years cause of some stuff called me out of the blue on thankgiving last year. I called back and got a hospital number so I knew something was up. Ended up being a kid who I was friends with years before but was a huge douche to me. He was in the psych ward for trying to kill himself. I got a hold of him and talked to him for a while. Whenever he would call I would answer and be there even though I still had the shit from years earlier on my mind. There are people that I might not want to be around but if it's a situation like this I'll be there for people. My goal or purpose in life that's sustained my survival is to help make other peoples lives a little bit better. Make people laugh when they're sad, help people out when nobody else will. Basically treat other humans even strangers with the respect and kindness of a friend. That's all people need sometime. Let people talk through their shit with me and offer helpful advice if I can. I'm still swimming in my own shit but that's enough to keep me going, keep that little light at the end of the tunnel switched on. Idk how long that will last but I'll be here till it flickers out."
